the permission to sleep in zoom meetings

## what it does
lazzzy let's you join a meeting, turn off your mic and camera and leave to:
- sleep
- watch netflix
- play soccer
- anything you want to do outside being in a meeting,
because it will send you an sms whenever someone calls your name in the call. 

p.s. people who use this are liable to be laid off.
