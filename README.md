# lazzzy
the permission to sleep in zoom meetings

## what it does
lazzzy let's you turn off your mic and camera in a meeting and leave to:
- sleep
- watch netflix
- play soccer, or
- anything you want to do outside being in a meeting,

because it will send you an sms notification whenever someone calls your name in the call. 

p.s. people who use lazzzy are liable to drop out of school or get laid off.
